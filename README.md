# Call a REST Web Service

Call a REST Web Service
In this sample, we illustrate how to make use of the Call Web Service action. The action calls a REST web service and then uses the returned data to populate the controls on the page. In the sample we call the Random User API web service which returns a random user for us. We then make use of the nationality of the user to get the person Country name by calling the Country API web service..
